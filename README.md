## Abstract 

Detection identifies objects as axis-aligned boxes in an image. Most successful object detectors enumerate a nearly exhaustive list of potential object locations and classify each. This is wasteful, inefficient, and requires additional post-processing. In this paper, we take a different approach. We model an object as a single point -- the center point of its bounding box. Our detector uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, orientation, and even pose. Our center point based approach, CenterNet, is end-to-end differentiable, simpler, faster, and more accurate than corresponding bounding box based detectors. CenterNet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off on the MS COCO dataset, with 28.1% AP at 142 FPS, 37.4% AP at 52 FPS, and 45.1% AP with multi-scale testing at 1.4 FPS. We use the same approach to estimate 3D bounding box in the KITTI benchmark and human pose on the COCO keypoint dataset. Our method performs competitively with sophisticated multi-stage methods and runs in real-time.

## Highlights

- **Simple:** Without using Dilation nor Deformable Conv. Only standard convolution, interpolation and point-wise arithmetic operation were used.

- **Fast:** The whole process in a single network feedforward. No NMS post processing is needed. Our DLA-34 model runs at *35* FPS with *41.1* COCO AP.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](readme/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

## Use CenterNet

We support demo for image/ image folder, video, and webcam. 

First, download the models (By default, [ctdet_coco_dla_2x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pl_-ael8wERdUREEnaIfqOV_VF2bEVRT) for detection and 
[multi_pose_dla_3x](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PO1Ax_GDtjiemEmDVD7oPWwqQkUu28PI) for human pose estimation) 
from the [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md) and put them in `CenterNet_ROOT/models/`.

For object detection on images/ video, run:

~~~
python demo.py ctdet --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video --load_model ../models/ctdet_coco_dla_2x.pth
~~~
We provide example images in `CenterNet_ROOT/images/` (from [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/tree/master/demo)). If set up correctly, the output should look like

<p align="center"> <img src='readme/det1.png' align="center" height="230px"> <img src='readme/det2.png' align="center" height="230px"> </p>

For webcam demo, run     

~~~
python demo.py ctdet --demo webcam --load_model ../models/ctdet_coco_dla_2x.pth
~~~

Similarly, for human pose estimation, run:

~~~
python demo.py multi_pose --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video/or/webcam --load_model ../models/multi_pose_dla_3x.pth
~~~
The result for the example images should look like:

<p align="center">  <img src='readme/pose1.png' align="center" height="200px"> <img src='readme/pose2.png' align="center" height="200px"> <img src='readme/pose3.png' align="center" height="200px">  </p>

You can add `--debug 2` to visualize the heatmap outputs.
You can add `--flip_test` for flip test.

To use this CenterNet in your own project, you can 

~~~
import sys
CENTERNET_PATH = /path/to/CenterNet/src/lib/
sys.path.insert(0, CENTERNET_PATH)

from detectors.detector_factory import detector_factory
from opts import opts

MODEL_PATH = /path/to/model
TASK = 'ctdet' # or 'multi_pose' for human pose estimation
opt = opts().init('{} --load_model {}'.format(TASK, MODEL_PATH).split(' '))
detector = detector_factory[opt.task](opt)

img = image/or/path/to/your/image/
ret = detector.run(img)['results']
~~~
`ret` will be a python dict: `{category_id : [[x1, y1, x2, y2, score], ...], }`

## Benchmark Evaluation and Training

After [installation](readme/INSTALL.md), follow the instructions in [DATA.md](readme/DATA.md) to setup the datasets. Then check [GETTING_STARTED.md](readme/GETTING_STARTED.md) to reproduce the results in the paper.
We provide scripts for all the experiments in the [experiments](experiments) folder.

## Develop

If you are interested in training CenterNet in a new dataset, use CenterNet in a new task, or use a new network architecture for CenterNet, please refer to [DEVELOP.md](readme/DEVELOP.md). Also feel free to send us emails for discussions or suggestions.
